Hello,

Most of the time I spent with the UI, to archive the desired goal with swiping, particularly. Also, for network service I reused some code that I usually use for my pet projects or test tasks.

I used only SwiftUI, but for lower iOS versions I might have done it in another way, maybe even with UIKit

The difference in this task compared to the Down production app is that user is able to swipe up and down nad eventually make a final decision only when gesture ends. In the production app if user swiped up,
action is triggered immideately.

I didn't use any caching, because there was no such requirement, but they would help with images a lot.

I used one dependecy from Apple for more type strict HTTP.

Thanks in advance
